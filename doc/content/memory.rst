Loading into memory
###################
This submodule enables you to read tracks into memory and to write tracks from memory using dictionaries. Doing this can quickly create memory problems, and is discouraged. However, if you know your track is not very large, and you want to load in the RAM, you can.

.. autofunction:: track.memory.read
.. autofunction:: track.memory.write
