Installation
############

To install you can simply type::

    $ sudo easy_install empty

That's it. However, if that doesn't work because you don't have sufficient permissions, you can simply install it somewhere else (for instance in your home)::

    $ cd ~
    $ pip install -e git+https://github.com/xapple/track
